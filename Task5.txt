Line 3:
Prefer to have stylesheets in their own file to provide better separation of concerns

Line 7:
Misspelling of the word "Fuel"
Instead of passing this as a child, we should pass it as a normal prop. eg "fuel" instead of "children"
Also, we could destructure the props to make it cleaner to read, eg `{fuel}` instead of `props` in the method signature.
If you do, you'll need to update Line 8 to.

Line 8:
In line with comment on Line 3, we should be using className and CSS classes, directly styling components can make maintainability difficult

Line 11:
We could destructure `fuel` to make it more readable

Line 13:
Please rename your state returns to something more meaningful, perhaps "showAlert" and "setShowAlert"
Although please refer to my comments for 15-19.

Line 15-19:
This code will run every re-render even if fuel hasn't changed value.
We should be limiting the scope of useEffect to the variables we're watching for state changes.

However you could simplify this component by removing useState and useEffect and have the return based on the value of fuel.

Let me know when you're free for a chat and we can go through

Line 16:
Can we confirm the definition of "too much fuel" with the product owner please

Line 28 - 59:
This should be in it's own, functional component and not extending the App Component.
Helps provide better separation of concerns and ensures that features are isolated to their own components.

Line 33:
Please rename the states to something more meaningful, eg instead of `x` and `f` it should be `position` and `fuel`
It makes it easier to read and makes the code self documenting


Line 39 - 45:
setInterval isn't reliable for animations, cycles can be missed, it doesn't take advantage of dedicated rendering and can cause a poor user experience.
A better approach would be to use requestAnimationFrame or CSS animations

Let's chat through it when you're free

Line 47:
In-line with my comment for Line 33, we can then destructure state to
const { position, fuel } = this?.state;
Which will make the code more readable, make sure to update Lines 54 and 55

Please use let or const to ensure we maintain better control over the scope of our variables, var will be hoisted to the immediate function body
which whilst not an issue here, can cause confusion and bugs as the application grows.

Line 54:
Typo is the word "CarsFuel"
We shouldn't be passing fuel as a child element, it should be passed as a prop
